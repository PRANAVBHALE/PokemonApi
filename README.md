# PokemonApp.
  Built a React application around Pokemon API.
  
# Api Endpoints used:
  
  PokemonList - https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=50&limit=50
  
  PokemonDetails - https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/:name
  
# This app covers the following aspects:
  - A paginated list of Pokémons (50 per page).
  - A click based favorite selection
  - Clicking on any Pokémon opens a new page with the details for the selected
    Pokémon.
  - Functional components using React hooks.
  - Unit tests for the list and single page.
